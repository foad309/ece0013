                <h4>Design goals</h4>
                <dd>  &nabla; The most common goals in computer architecture revolve around the tradeoffs between cost and performance (i.e. speed), although other considerations, such as size, weight, reliability, feature set, expandability and power consumption, may be factors as well.</dd>

                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Cost</h4>
                <dd> &nabla; Generally cost is held constant, determined by either system or commercial requirements, and speed and storage capacity are adjusted to meet the cost target.</dd>
<br>

                <h4>Performance</h4>
                <dd> &nabla; Computer retailers describe the performance of their machines in terms of clock speed(usually in MHz or GHz). This refers to the cycles per second of the main clock of the CPU. However, this metric is somewhat misleading, as a machine with a higher clock rate may not necessarily have higher performance. Modern CPUs can execute multiple instructions per clock cycle, which dramatically speeds-up a program. Other factors aid speed, such as the mix of functional units, bus speeds, available memory, and the type and order of instructions in the programs being run.
<br>            
                   &nabla;But there are also different types of speed. Interrupt latency is the guaranteed maximum response time of the system to an electronic event (e.g. when the disk drive finishes moving some data). This number is affected by a very wide range of design choicesâ€”for example, adding cache usually makes latency worse (slower) but makes other things faster. Computers that control machinery usually need low interrupt latencies, because the machine can't, won't or should not wait. For example, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes should not wait for the computer to finish what it's doing - they should brake. Low latencies can often be had very inexpensively.</dd>
